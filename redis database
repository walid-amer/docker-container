-	DOCKER PULL REDIS                                (TO DOWNLOAD THE IMAGE FROM THE HUB)
      DOCKER IMAGES                                    (WE WILL SEE IT)
     - Docker run –d  - - name redisserver  redis 
     - Docker run –it - - name redisclient1 --link redisserver:redis  redis sh
                 (Run a other container of the redis image called redis client 
                 : redis is the alias to pooint to the server container ) 
      to test the connection between client and server :
       - cat /etc/hosts 
        (we can SEE the port id of the server and the ip so we can ping it  )
        
                 
     Now connect to the redis server
- Redis-cli –h redis    (cli mean client : and h mean host : connectcfrom client to server : you can test by : ping it giv pong. inside server now)

     let save sume data:
Setmyname walid
Set my country Lebanon
               If I do  
  get myname wil return walid
  
               run a nother client container and connect to the server I should be able to get the data :
                       
-	Docker run –it - - name redisclient2 --link redisserver:redis  redis sh
-	Redis-cli –h redis
-	Get myname : it givs walid

Nb(we are here in a new container)
