Once you’ve built or created a new image you can push it to Docker Hub using :
- docker images                                           (to show the local images)
- docker tag image-id wamer/mywebsite                     (exemple) (it appear a new image locally as wamer/mywebsite)
-docker images                                              (it appear)
-docker login
  User name(w....) and password(m….)
-docker push wamer/mywebsite                               (push to repository in cloud)
                                                            Now we can see our images in docker hub account 
And we can pull it:  - docker pull wamer/mywebsite
